# WagoLoader
Tool to prepare new WAGO controller with all necessary settings - no CodeSys / e!Cockpit necessary.

Need to setup factory new controllers?
Is there more to do as to copy the software?

This tool should do it.

Create a package including all content and information for the target system.
Load that package on a new system using network connection only.
